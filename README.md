+ Water pump system made with the PIC16F84A

+ Proteus 7 was used for its simulation.


## OPERATION MODE

Button 1 will turn on the Green led indicating that pump 1 is operable, button 2 will turn on the Yellow led which indicates that pump 2 is operable, button 3 will turn on the power cycle of pump 1 for 30 seconds later, it will turn off and pump 2 will turn on for 30 seconds, this cycle is infinite, button 4 turns on both leds, therefore both water pumps at the same time. You can only press one button per cycle, if you want to press another button you must restart the pump system and then press the button again.
